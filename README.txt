#Scripts VBS

-------------------------------------------------------

 Script VBS
    VBS (Windows 10)
    Writen Specificaly for an Active Directory
    
--------------------------------------------------------

 A simple repository where I store my script VBS to 
    handle an Active Directory. This repository is for
    references purposes only, it has no real value in
    and on itself.

 
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 Writen while on an Intenship to handle various things
    needed by my Tutor.     
---------------------------------------------------------

Being relativly new to programming, as well as 100% self taught! My work might be a little basic and redondante some times.
If you decide to help explain any changes you make; why the changes? and how is it better?... This is so I might learn, ty. 
(ps: please explain in ways a baby could understant... Comments such as "this or that already existe!!!" does not help!)
